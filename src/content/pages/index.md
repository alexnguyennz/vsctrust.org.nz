Vulnerable Support Charitable Trust is a leading provider of support to those who are at risk of harm across Wellington, Porirua, and Hutt Valley.

At the heart of our holistic practice model is a firm basis of reducing harm, promoting respect, and working towards an equitable future.  We respect all communities and provide support in a non-judgemental and inclusive manner.

We recently expanded our work into Tāmaki Makarua (Auckland), with Take 10 opening in the city in July 2025. After receiving an awesome welcome from a new city, we have been so happy to find we are able to support a whole new group of people.

Our vision is for inclusive local communities where all people are prospering, able to achieve their goals, valued, and protected from harm.

Our mission is to provide support to those who are vulnerable in our local communities through action-oriented programmes that make change; with demonstrable positive outcomes that both bring communities together, and at the same time promote inclusion, equity, and social cohesion.
