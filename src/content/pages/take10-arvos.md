<p class="text-xl font-extrabold">
Our focus is to increase the reach Take 10 has in the community by
extending the services we offer to rangatahi in the form of a youth
zone.
</p>

During the school term, we are at:

- [Linden Community Centre](https://wellington.govt.nz/community-support-and-resources/resources-and-facilities/community-centres/locations/linden-community-centre) (10 Linden Avenue, Linden) every Tuesday and Thursday from 3 to 5pm
- [Johnsonville Community Centre](https://www.johnsonvillecommunitycentre.org.nz/) (3 Frankmoore Ave, Johnsonville) every Friday from 3 to 5pm

Take 10 Arvo's aims to:
- support rangatahi
- provide a safe and fun space for them to come to after school

We keep our "safe zone" welcoming and non-judgmental, by:
-always using positive language
-greeting visitors with a smile, water, and lollies
-providing a private space for those who need more attention
