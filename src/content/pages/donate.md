  Kia ora,


  Thank you for taking the time to consider donating to us.


  Our organisation works to create change for younger generations within our
  local communities across Wellington, Porirua, and Hutt Valley.


  Our targeted programmes offer support, care, and create connections.


  Through our work we build stronger, safer, and more inclusive communities.


  We have also recently expanded into Auckland with our programme Take 10
  establishing a positive presence in the Queen Street and Te Komititanga Square
  area.


  We know our work makes a real impact.


  If you choose to donate to us, know that you are choosing to make an impact
  too.
