Do Some Good's food support programme ensures all tamariki across Wellington, Porirua, and the Hutt Valley have access to fresh and tasty kai throughout their day in education, including lunch, breakfast, and snacks.

Our programme started with one school in Wainuiomata in 2017, before expanding out to support more schools and kindergartens across Wellington, Porirua and Hutt Valley.

The food support programme addresses not only the physical but emotional and educational needs of tamariki. A well-fed child is better able to engage and focus on their learnings.

Many whānau are often able to take leftover kai home to make meals throughout the week and we are often told by education providers we work with that our support acts as an equaliser, meaning our programme contributes to all tamariki having the opportunity to thrive and flourish in education and at home.

We work with corporate partners to deliver our programme, providing them with the opportunity to be part of a concerted effort to create social cohesion and well-connected communities, where everyone is doing their bit and tamariki experiencing hardship are protected from harm.

Our corporate partners also volunteer their time at kura, completing needed mahi during volunteer working bees, a real highlight for both the volunteers and schools, as both groups have the opportunity to meet new people and celebrate the day with a sausage sizzle after mahi is completed.

Recently, our food support programme has felt the impact of the continuing cost-of-living crisis and current economic climate, with less funding available to support our work and an increased need in the community.

We remain hopeful the community will step up and demonstrate their aroha for our tamariki to ensure we can continue to deliver our programme for tamariki who need it in our community.

Now is the time to show your support.

If you are, or know of a business or individual who is able to and would like to give back to the community and make a difference in the lives of our tamariki, please get in touch.

We are also very interested in hearing from businesses, groups, or individuals who would like to undertake community fundraising with us.
