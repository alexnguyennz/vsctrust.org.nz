Do Some Good's School Lunch Project ensure tamariki in all Wellington communities have access to food during their school day.

The School Lunch Project addresses not only the physical but emotional and educational needs of tamariki. A well-fed child is better able to engage and focus on their learnings.

Do Some Good started with one school in Wainuiomata in 2017, and now supports 16 schools in the wider Wellington region from Porirua to Ōwhiro Bay.

Kiwi kids living in hardship deserve more support, opportunities and experiences from the wider community. With many businesses seeking to promote corporate social responsibility, we aim to direct their focus, and their customised offer of support, to kids that need it the most.
