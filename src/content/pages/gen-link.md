<p class="text-xl font-extrabold">
  Generation Link aims to lessen the generation gap by connecting
  tamariki with older folk within their local communities.
</p>

Gen Link aims to:

- connect our young and older people
- reduce isolation of older people

Working alongside schools already involved with Do Some Good, Gen Link will provide and facilitate the transport and support to bring seniors from their home to tamariki at school, during school hours.

Seniors will be encouraged to interact with the children through facilitated and organised activities such as book reading, storytelling, playing board games, and gardening.
