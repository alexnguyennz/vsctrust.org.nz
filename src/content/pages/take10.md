<p class="text-xl font-extrabold">
Take 10 is a late-night "safe zone" for vulnerable youth in
Wellington’s entertainment district.
</p>

For those who may need a break from drinking, need help, or just want
a break, we provide a safe place to “take 10”. People can hang out,
have some water, charge their phone to stay in touch with friends and
family, get medical help, refuge, and advice from our fully trained
team leaders and volunteers.

Our base is on Courtenay Place in the form of a mobile unit which can
be used not only in central Wellington but also in the wider
Wellington Region.

What makes us different?

- **Preventative** – we catch people before they become
  victims by stopping them from becoming isolated and helping to
  reconnect people
- **Approach-able** – people are often more willing to
  come to us than the police or emergency services
- **Safe** – we give people a safe place to go - where they can charge their phones, take a break, sober up, have a chat, get medical support, and get help to get home safely
