As of 2025 the [cost of living crisis is affecting 1 in 2 people in Aotearoa](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK2503/S00308/one-in-two-new-zealanders-are-affected-by-the-cost-of-living-crisis.htm#:~:text=One%20In%20Two%20New%20Zealanders,%E2%80%A2), which has been linked to reported child poverty levels remaining steady at 11.7% to 13.7%, and we fear that under-reporting may mean this number is significantly higher.

Do Some Good, our Food Support Programme, is here to provide support to tamariki and their whānau throughout Wellington, Hutt Valley, and Porirua, providing kai to kindergartens and schools.
