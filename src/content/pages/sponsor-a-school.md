As of 2025 the [cost of living crisis is affecting 1 in 2 people in Aotearoa](https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK2503/S00308/one-in-two-new-zealanders-are-affected-by-the-cost-of-living-crisis.htm#:~:text=One%20In%20Two%20New%20Zealanders,%E2%80%A2), which has been linked to reported child poverty levels remaining steady at 11.7% to 13.7%.

Do Some Good’s Food Support Programme is here to alleviate the pressures felt by tamariki and their whānau through providing kai to education providers across Wellington, Hutt Valley, and Porirua.
