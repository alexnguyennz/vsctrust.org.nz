title: Sponsor a School
---

In 2020/21 one in six children lived in households where food ran out sometimes (**12.0%**) or often (**2.9%**) due to a lack of money.

We want to help build connections between businesses and low decile schools to generate positive change in how we look after our people.

Each business will have something different to offer or a different way in which they can help.
