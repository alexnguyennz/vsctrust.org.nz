**Update:**  Our successful 10-week pilot has now concluded, but we are happy to announce we will be back soon with a pop-up running from 14th November to 13th of December at Te Komititanga Square from 10:00 pm to 3:00 am on Friday and Saturday nights, and then back again at the start of February next year for 2026.

We felt so inspired by the hospitality and aroha of the people of Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland) throughout our ten-week pilot; the opportunity to meet so many new faces and be welcomed into the city was a huge privilege.

The volunteers who came on board to support our work and spend their Friday and Saturday nights with us at Ellen Melville Centre and Te Komititanga Square, are a testament to the power of communities to support one another, and create meaningful connections through shared experiences, such as playing games and engaging in kōrero, resulting in a safer and more inclusive nightlife environment, for everyone. We are so looking forward to spending our weekend nights with them again and connecting with the community.

And of course we want to take a moment to extend a huge thank you to Auckland Council for their continual support making all of this possible.

Kia ora Auckland!

We are so excited to be expanding into Auckland with a 10 week pilot supported by Auckland Council, starting on the 18th of July.

In Auckland, Take10 will be providing the same great services that make it such a relied upon safe-zone in Central Wellington, games, phone charging, water, transport advice, first-aid medical support, friendly trained volunteers who love to kōrero with anyone who visits, and acting as a safe spot for people to relax, take a break or come to if they are lost or become separated from the people they are with.

We'll be set up outside Ellen Melville Centre, every weekend over the 10-week pilot from 10:00pm to 3:00am, Friday and Saturday night.

Taking our mahi into a new city and being able to meet, and support a whole new group of people is something we are so looking forward too.

If you are on a night out drop by and say Kia ora, we would love to meet you!

What makes us different?

* **Preventative** – we catch people before they become victims by stopping them from becoming isolated and helping to reconnect people
* **Approach-able** – people are often more willing to come to us than the police or emergency services
* **Safe** – we give people a safe place to go - where they can charge their phones, take a break, sober up, have a chat, get medical support, and get help to get home safely
