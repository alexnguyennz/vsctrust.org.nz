We are so excited to be back in Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland) again for 2026, in our new venue, Te Wharekura on Quay Street.

We felt so inspired by the hospitality and aroha of the people of Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland) throughout our ten-week pilot; the opportunity to meet so many new faces and be welcomed into the city was a huge privilege.

The volunteers who came on board to support our work and spend their Friday and Saturday nights with us at Ellen Melville Centre and Te Komititanga Square, are a testament to the power of communities to support one another.  <br><br>We create meaningful connections through shared experiences, such as playing games and engaging in kōrero, resulting in a safer and more inclusive nightlife environment, for everyone.

And of course we want to take a moment to extend a huge thank you to Auckland Council for their continual support making all of this possible.

What makes us different?

* **Preventative** – we catch people before they become victims by stopping them from becoming isolated and helping to reconnect people
* **Approach-able** – people are often more willing to come to us than the police or emergency services
* **Safe** – we give people a safe place to go - where they can charge their phones, take a break, sober up, have a chat, get medical support, and get help to get home safely
