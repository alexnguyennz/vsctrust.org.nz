Coming from the hospitality industry, Clint believes in making a place better than when you found it, especially when it comes to helping youth. Heâ€™s keen to break the cycle of drinking (with Take 10) and the cycle of poverty (with Do Some Good), and create positive experiences for older folk with Generation Link.

Clint has a 16-year-old son and an 8-year-old daughter. He sits on the board of the Hospitality Association, Wellington Branch, and is Chair of the Redwood School Board.
