Having spent time running entertainment venues around NZ, Adam is passionate about creating a positive drinking culture, and having space where at-risk youth can take time out or get help when they are out (at Take 10).

Adam has two young children and believes strongly that no child should have to go through a school day on an empty stomach, and if we can pay it forward we encourage growth and development of our youngest stars (via Do some Good).
