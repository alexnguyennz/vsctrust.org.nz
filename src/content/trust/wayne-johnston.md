Wayne is a family man – father of two and grandfather of three. Since 2008 he has turned his business acumen to the running of three major whānau-owned businesses.

Wayne is Chairman of the Te Awe Board because he wants to give something back to the Māori world that he is a part of. The VSCT is lucky to have a man of Wayne’s calibre and experience who is willing to give some of his valuable time and experience to helping others.
