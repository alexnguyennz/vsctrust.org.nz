. I’m a Wellingtonian through and through. I love going for walks around the hills or coasts, and dabble in hobbies like piano, creative writing, badminton, and have taken up knitting this winter. My interests also include conservation work as well as other areas that rely on volunteers.

My work background is in hospitality, having studied to start a journey in cheffing. My time in a rest-home kitchen turned me off of that though and the stress I was subjected to in that role had lasting effects on my physical and mental health. It’s been a long path to recovery and I am only just this past year feeling ready to start attempting more than part-time work.

Through volunteering I was introduced to Leigh and given the opportunity to work for VSCT and Do Some Good. I enjoy being on the road delivering food to schools and kindergartens right across Wellington, meeting like-minded and wonderfully friendly people in the community and the VSCT family, but most of all I am glad to be providing a basic necessity to those who too often go without. It falls on those of us who can afford food to provide for those that can’t.

This is exactly the sort of work I want to be doing, I’ve had a blast so far (even on the rainy days), and I hope to be able to do more good for the people of Wellington in the near future.Add the team member's background or description here.
