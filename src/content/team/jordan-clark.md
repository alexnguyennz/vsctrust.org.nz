  Jordan is a Wellingtonian through and through. He loves going for walks around
  the hills or coasts, and dabbling in hobbies like piano, creative writing,
  badminton, and he has recently taken up knitting. His interests include
  conservation work as well as other areas that rely on volunteers.

Jordan's work background is in hospitality, having studied to start a journey to become a chef. His time in a rest-home kitchen changed his mind as the stress of  that role had lasting effects on his physical and mental health.

Through volunteering Jordan was introduced to Leigh and given the opportunity to work for VSCT and Do Some Good. Jordan enjoys being on the road delivering food to schools and kindergartens right across Wellington, meeting like-minded and wonderfully friendly people in the community and the VSCT family, but most of all Jordan is glad to be providing a basic necessity to those who too often go without. Jordan believes it falls on those of us who can afford food to provide for those that can’t.

''This is exactly the sort of work I want to be doing, I’ve had a blast so far (even on the rainy days), and I hope to be able to do more good for the people of Wellington in the near future''
