The Vulnerable Support Charitable Trust is growing rapidly. We are excited to continue our mission to amplify the good and support the vulnerable, and we are grateful to our partners and sponsors for believing in our cause and helping us to make it happen.

In the past month, Ali has joined the team and we have moved into a new office. We are excited to welcome Ali to our team! Ali is originally from the United States and moved to New Zealand last March 2018. Ali graduated from university in 2017, and since has been working in the communications and operations field. Her role is operations coordinator. She will take charge of social media and lead the Take 10 side of our charity. What she loves about New Zealand is all of the greenery and fresh air. She admires how much kiwis care for their environment. What excites her about her new role is to work for a real purpose and help make a positive difference in New Zealand.

Leigh is a kiwi born and bred and has lived all over the country, from Queenstown to the Coromandel. She has a background in hospitality and event management and is now studying part time. Leigh takes charge of the grant application process and leads the Do Some Good side of our charity. Having watched and supported the Trust’s journey with Clint since its conception, it’s exciting for Leigh to be on board.  Seeing how VSCT makes a real impact in the lives of young kiwis, from feeding them to interacting with them on our volunteer days is what excites Leigh. There isn’t anything better than seeing a smile on a kid’s face and knowing you help put it there. 

We have moved into our bright and sunny new office in Thorndon. Ali and Leigh are having a great time decorating and make it their own. We are doing some renovations and are working towards creating a boardroom and a comfy lounge space. We want the space to be warm and welcoming for all of our future visitors.

The addition of our new team and our office space has put us in the position to be as productive and efficient as we can be. We have exciting things planned for 2019, and we cannot wait to get started!
