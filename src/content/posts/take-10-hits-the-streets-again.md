We are already heading into week four of Take 10 … Each week has brought something different; Wellington provided a stunning night for our opening. After Beers in the Basin during the day, there were lots of people out enjoying the glorious weather. We handed out 1605 glasses of water through the night and x number of lollies.

The second was a night of storms, thankfully the rain held off until around 3am! The stormy weather didn’t stop people from getting out and about with lots of Christmas parties and celebrations going on in and around the city. 1872 glasses of water were handed out.

Week three was more of the same with lots of Christmas festivities, people were happy to have a glass of water on their travels and lots stopped by for a game of Jenga/Connect Four and to chat to the Take 10 team with 2108 glasses of water consumed.

Our team of volunteers is what makes Take 10 so special, they happily give up their Saturday evenings making sure Wellingtonians and visitors to Wellington are kept safe on their night out. Their positive energy, passion and team focus is amazing, and we are very grateful to have them on the Take 10 team.

If you are out in Wellington City on a Saturday night, stop by for a glass of water and a chat or if you would like to volunteer you can get in touch with Leigh: [hello@vsctrust.org.nz](mailto:hello@vsctrust.org.nz)
