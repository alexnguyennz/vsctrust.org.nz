Take 10 has received incredible recognition from the Wellington Community. We have won the Safety award and the Gratitude award. The safety award recognises and celebrates individuals, groups, programmes and safety heroes that make exceptional contributions to the safety of the city and is awarded by Wellington City Council.

Mayor Justin Lester said, “Over the years, we’ve honoured heroes from all walks of life and for all sorts of acts of bravery, emergency responses, crime prevention, and community safety campaigns and initiatives – but one thing they all have in common is they all deserved the recognition.”

Take 10 received the award because of its focus on ending sexual violence in Wellington. We do this by focusing on reducing alcohol-related harm. 

Take 10 was also honoured with the Gratitude award by Inner city Wellington. Their mission is to serve as a progressive and influential community voice of all for the residents, organisation and property owners in the suburbs of Te Aro and wellington central. They want to enhance the well being of all those living, owning and operating in the inner city.

Take 10 received the award because of our mission to enhance the well being of youth out in Courtenay Place.

There is nothing like Take 10 in New Zealand and we are proud of that. It is inclusive and open to the public. We accept all walks of life to come use our space. Our atmosphere is fun and positive. We are non-judgmental, and we prevent negative situations from occurring. We make sure our youth have a safe space to go to if they should need it.
