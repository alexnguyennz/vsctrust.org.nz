I have been Operations Manager for Vulnerable Support Charitable Trust for 7 years. Throughout this time, I’ve always been inspired by the passion and dedication of our Take10 volunteer team in helping others - the way they show up for people every weekend at our spot on Courtenay Place, and at events we are at such as Homegrown and Brewtown. Leading Take10 and seeing the initiative continue to grow and evolve, having more and more people know they can come to us, is also incredible.

I am really excited Take10 expanding into Auckland with a 10 week pilot supported by Auckland Council. It’s great to have them on board for the pilot, we had been in talks in the past about getting a Take10 running in Auckland and I am so glad that the pilot has given us an opportunity now. Running both Wellington and Auckland sites will be a challenge but we have a fantastic Wellington team, and I am sure we will build a fantastic team in Auckland too.

When I volunteer on-site at Take10, I really enjoy working with our volunteers, and meeting and chatting with all the people who visit us. As well as being a part of events like Homegrown. But it also isn’t easy being out in the middle of winter in the cold, wind, and rain. The same goes for seeing people at their most vulnerable and knowing we can’t always help. Being a part of a team and working together to do what we can for people means we can lean on each other when things are tough.

Recently, our volunteer team came second in the ‘Volunteer Team’, award category at the Mahi Aroha Awards, an awards night put on by Volunteer Wellington to celebrate the work of volunteers across our region. For me, it felt amazing to see our volunteer team recognised for their contributions, all of those nights they have been out until 3am the next morning, and time they gave up to volunteer at events. Seeing the rest of the teams and individual volunteers from across our region, and hearing about all of the work they do is something I am also really grateful for.

Since Take10 started, it’s been hard to see the closure of bars and restaurants on Courtenay Place. I feel for the owners of these venues, who wanted to give people a place to come to be together and enjoy each other’s company.

After the pandemic, and now during the continuing cost of living crisis we have also seen an increase in people visiting Take10 struggling with their mental health, particularly people feeling more anxious or depressed. It’s confronting seeing how this has really affected everyone. Safety is also a big concern for everyone on Courtenay Place at the moment, we are thankful we have a security guard on site and for all of the work that goes into keeping people safe in the central city.

It doesn’t take a lot to change someone’s night, most people just need to talk and be heard. When all you are doing is having a chat, listening and giving someone some time, it’s really touching to hear them say thanks for helping me and know that you have made a difference. These are some of my most memorable moments; talking with people and somehow making their night a bit better, seeing people leave Take 10 more settled than when they arrived or with some options to deal with a problem they may be having. Often, after we’ve helped someone, they come up to us on another weekend and share how we made a difference during their night. This feedback is a real testament to the value of the work we do, and how needed it is.
