The connection between young people and their grandparents is an undeniably strong one and one that creates positive and long-lasting benefits for both.

With global travel and people working all over the world, grandparents do not always live in the same city as their grandchildren. Generation Link aims to create a link between older folk and tamariki by bringing them together with activities. It could be reading, gardening, crochet, knitting, carving, painting, or just sharing stories together. Spending regular time together creates a bond and has significant well-being benefits for both.

For older folk who might be living alone or not able to get around as freely as they once did, or even just wanting to get out for an afternoon with a group of friends a fun outing is included in the program.

Social isolation is being felt now more than ever and bringing the young and older people together, creates a link and eliminates that feeling of loneliness and separation.

We aim to introduce Generation Link to all our Do Some Good schools, and we look forward to rolling it out over the coming months.
