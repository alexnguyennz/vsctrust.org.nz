Wētā Workshop is teaming up with Do Some Good to support families from Ōwhiro Bay School. The partnership will enable regular food deliveries for their community Pataka, as well as opportunities for Volunteer Days throughout the year.

Wētā Workshop Co-CEOs David Wilks and Tainia Rodger says, it’s important for businesses to be involved in their local communities, and the initiative aligns perfectly with our values.

“We’re thrilled to be able to make a real, tangible difference for local Wellington families, and looking forward to working with Ōwhiro Bay School and the Vulnerable Support Charitable Trust to share our Wētā Workshop magic.”

School Principal Cilla Scott says, it’s tough out there at the moment, and the support definitely helps to take the pressure off our families.

“It’s fantastic to have Wētā Workshop on board and we can’t wait to see what will happen on our volunteer days when we have their wonderful crew in to help, the hardest part is deciding which project to tackle,” she adds.

We are very excited to work with partners like Wētā Workshop and see Do Some Good continue to have impact and grow across the region.
