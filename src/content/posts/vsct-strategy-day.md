On Saturday 8th of June, our board and staff got together for a strategy day where we created strategic goals and milestones for the Trust over the next 5 years. Our overall vision is to see an Aotearoa where everyone plays a part in all tamariki and rangatahi reaching their potential.

We had a blast working together and doing fun brainstorming activities. We decided that our values are to be bold, inclusive, transparent, and collaborative with the communities we are a part of. We are proud to have such awesome individuals as part of the VSCT team who bring fun to a serious job.

We have big goals to achieve for both Do Some Good and Take 10, that being we want to expand our projects to a larger scale, invest in the right people for our teams, and secure and diversify our funding. By 2025 we see Take 10 operating in 5 major New Zealand cities, and Do Some Good in 50 schools across the country.

We are a young and fast-growing organisation supported by board members and partner agencies with considerable experience who all want to make a positive difference. We really care and we will do the work that needs to be done. Watch this space for updates.
