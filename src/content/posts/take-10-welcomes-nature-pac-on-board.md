We are thrilled to welcome the team at Nature Pac as one of our key sponsors. They have very kindly provided us with their fantastic eco-friendly plant-based cups. At Take 10 we are always keen to do our bit for the environment and this seems like the perfect partnership.

On average we hand out 2000 cups of water to our visitors per night and we love that the Nature Pac cups are locally made, compostable and biodegradable.

Nature Pac is a 100% New Zealand owned and operated food packaging company that manufactures and distributes eco-friendly products in Wellington. You can see more of [Nature Pacâ€™s great products here](https://naturepac.co.nz/).

Come and see us on Saturday nights and grab a cup of water with our Nature Pac cups! ðŸ˜Š
