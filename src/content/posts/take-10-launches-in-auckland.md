Take 10 launched recently in Tāmaki Makarau (Auckland) with our 10 week pilot supported by Auckland Council beginning on the 18th of July, to coincide with the beginning of the second semester for tertiary students.

We are very grateful to the council for taking the step to support us and recognising Take 10 as an impactful harm reduction initiative. It is such an honour to be trusted to make a difference.

On launch night, we opened Take 10 outside Ellen Melville Centre with a karakia and many of the supporting organisations who had been working with us in the lead up to the pilot, including Auckland Council, Auckland University, St John, and others, were there to celebrate the beginning of a new journey for us.

After two initial weekends outside Ellen Melville Centre, feedback from the public that we might not be in the busiest area gave rise to a rethink on our location. So, after doing some scouting we’ve moved to the Quay Street area, ultimately settling at Te Komititanga Square. Since our move, we’ve had great engagement, and met so many people who have stopped by for a kōrero, water, and a lolly.

Talking with people about their night might seem like a small thing, but we see the immediate impact it makes, with people often becoming animated and open knowing someone is wanting to listen, and that someone cares.

Take 10 began as a pop up outside St James Theatre in 2016. People were drawn to what we offered straight away, lollies, phone chargers, games, a safe, non-judgemental and inclusive space to relax and take a break. We were given 2000 bottles of water to hand out, and they were gone within weeks. It gave us great confidence, to have such a great response from the public, right from the start.

These days in Wellington, on an average night we hand out 2000 cups of water, people recognise us, and we are very well known.

Getting Take 10 up and running was largely down to the relentless efforts of Clint Schoultz, the founder of Take 10. Through his dedication, the contributions and support of other board members, volunteers, and supporting organisations Take 10 was able to thrive, and we were able to navigate the unknowns that come along with starting something new.

A big part of what is making the pilot a success in Tāmaki Makarau and making the experience so great for us is again, working together with supporting organisations, volunteers, and the dedication of our team and board.

Looking to the future we feel very encouraged by what we have been able to achieve so far. When we received the green light from Auckland Council, we felt a mix of excitement, nervousness, and pride. Mostly we felt pride in our team and knowing what we do works, and is being noticed. We would love to see Take 10 in all cities around Aotearoa.
