We are excited to be teaming up with Pablos Art to deliver Art Therapy sessions at Take 10 Arvo's.

Sarah from Pablos Art has been running these workshops fortnightly at the Linden Community Centre. Sarah talks about art therapy saying, “I believe in the arts ability to heal and enable us to express ourselves where other outlets might fall short. The creative arts therapies encourage self-expression and foster exploration of our awareness, encourage emotional growth, and enhance relationships with ourselves and others.”

The art sessions are designed to improve mental well-being for rangatahi through getting creative and making art. Art therapy is founded on the philosophy that creative expression can promote healing and well-being. The best thing is that no art experience is needed\!

We recently had our first session and it was great to see our regular rangatahi getting involved and exploring their creative sides, even our volunteers got involved in the session. Next time we will be creating some murals outside. We look forward to seeing what the team creates! The last time we had the paints out, they created a beautiful landscape with a story behind the mural:

*Kua hora te marino I runga I te Moana Kahurangi*

*Kua pakū mai ngā maunga he rangitoto pera I te kaha, te matangareka o te tangata, ka pahore te Whero me Pungapunga*

*Ko te tae Kakariki e tohu mai ngā maunga ihiihi rātou ko ngā iwi o wenei Tamariki.*

*The blue ocean shows the calm presence*

*The red and yellow volcano shows energy and enthusiasm*

*The green is for the mountains and our iwi’s*

We love having new activations and workshops at Take 10 Arvo’s and we are looking forward to introducing more of these. We have some great ideas lined up, including guitar lessons\!&nbsp;

We hope you are all staying safe out there with Omicron and we cannot wait until this is over. For now, kia kaha, take care of one another.
