We’ve been thrilled to have Marcail join the team at Take 10 recently. It’s always exciting when new people come on board and Marcail has brought with her, her great love of community and collaboration.

I’ve absolutely loved my time at Take 10 so far, it’s been awesome getting to work in the community and with such a great team!

I joined Take 10 because I’m really passionate about city safety and building community. I’ve always loved the work Take 10 does to support Wellington nightlife and I wanted to get involved.

When I’m working on a Friday or Saturday night, the majority of people are really lovely - and it makes me so happy that almost everyone is up for a quick game of Connect 4!

Another big plus for me is having conversations with people about their life stories and hearing about the different journeys people have been on.

In the past, when I have been on nights out in the city, I have always loved the community on Courtenay Place, and how people are looking out for each other, I’ve had some of the loveliest chats in the girls' bathrooms and met so many different people.

Wellington is such a vibrant and full-of-life city. I’m really looking forward to what the future holds in store. Something I’m really excited about is the ongoing work of the city safety plan from WCC (Wellington City Council) and the efforts that have gone into keeping Pōneke a walkable city with ever-improving public transport options.
