We are very proud to have been featured in Stuff last weekend. Stuff reporter, Gianina Schwanecke, joined us for an evening to see what happens at Take 10, Gianina spent the night handing our waters, engaging with visitors, and speaking at length to our team to get a real understanding on what happens on a night at Take 10. She told us she thoroughly enjoyed the night and was grateful for the opportunity to join us for the night.

We are very grateful for our amazing team who give up their time on the weekends and we are super proud of the part we play in the P≈çneke Promise and ensuring Central Wellington is a safe and fun place to be on a night out!
