Our Take 10 mobile unit has finally arrived after its long journey from the UK.

After our site at St James Theatre was closed down due to earthquake strengthening in 2018, we had to get creative and find a new home. 

After a lot of research and discussion with our partners and people in the local community, it was decided to purchase a mobile unit. The unit has arrived in Auckland and will be all decked out in our branding before it makes its way to its home here in Wellington in the coming weeks.

Having this unit will give Take 10 flexibility. We will be parked on Courtenay Place next to Tommy Millions on Saturday nights and we also hope to take the unit to other major events in Wellington such as Homegrown. 

Our launch is just around the corner. We could not be more excited!
