We hope you have all had a well-deserved restful break and a very happy start to 2022.

We are back in action and have had a week of planning for all the happenings across our four programs. The beginning of a New Year is always an exciting time where we brainstorm what we are wanting to achieve and set goals for the year. We hope you are as excited as we are to get things going this year.

**Take 10 nights**&nbsp;has been pumping in the weekends with New Year’s Eve being an extra busy night in Wellington Central. Many familiar faces and many newcomers were welcomed through the support zone as the 31st rolled into the 1st.

Our plans to spread awareness in Wellington is growing and we hope to see some of you during O-Week and of course stopping by to hang out with our crew on Friday and Saturday nights.

**Take 10 Arvo’s**&nbsp;is ready to start up again, with some exciting things lined up:

- We’re back at the Linden Community Centre starting 11 January. We will be there on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 3 pm – 5 pm.
- We’re teaming up with Migrants Aotearoa to host a multi-cultural afternoon tea and kōrero over kai to connect tamariki and rangatahi on Wednesday 19 January at Johnsonville Collective Community Hub and Thursday 20 January at Linden Community Centre both days 1.30 pm – 5 pm.
- We are also hosting an afternoon hangout on 21 February from 2 pm – 5 pm at the Collective Community Hub in Johnsonville for young Type 1 Diabetics in the Wellington region alongside Diabetes Youth Wellington. There has been lots of interest from the Type 1 community and many individuals putting their hands up to volunteer.

**Do Some Good**&nbsp;is rearing to go and we look forward to welcoming schools back in early February. We have some plans up our sleeves to be more involved in the schools throughout 2022. Stay tuned\!

Lastly,**&nbsp;Generation Link**&nbsp;is in full kickstart mode after being put on hold at the end of 2021 due to Covid-19 restrictions. We have been working in the background to come up with new and safe ways of connecting older folk and tamariki. Keep an eye out for what is to come.

Once again, welcome back, and let’s make the most of what 2022 has to offer.
