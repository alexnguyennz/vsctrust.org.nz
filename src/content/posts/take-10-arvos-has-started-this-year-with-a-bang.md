We set up the mobile truck in the Grasslees area in Tawa where we met a great bunch of students from Tawa Intermediate and Tawa High School, we played many games of giant Jenga and Connect Four, some getting pretty competitive but all in good faith. We handed out Goodbuzz Kombucha and lots of fruit during the Arvo’s, it was great to see so many passing through. Our first rainy day hit, and we sat down to prepare for the upcoming winter months.

We headed to the Linden Community Centre to trial our very first school holiday programme and what a fun opportunity to get to know more local rangatahi and their whānau. We set up two days each week and provided lunch and snacks throughout the days. Two of our buddies even helped make pasta for all the others which was an absolute hit! We kickstarted our first workshop with local hip-hop dancer Josh Mitikulena and his crew. We painted seedling pots and planted carrots! It is safe to say the school holiday programme was a hit and we had a lot of fun playing games and hanging out.

We are now set up at the Linden Community Centre for terms 2 and 3. The table tennis and fuzeball are great assets and there is a space to set up the 24 computers we have coming from the Tawa Tech Group. We have spoken to the Year 9 & 10’s at Tawa High School and we look forward to seeing some new faces at the Arvo’s moving forward.

As for our Waitangi Park set up, we are enjoying the company of familiar faces at the skate park. We had Jason Woodroofe come and set up a skate workshop. Jason and the crew at the skate park set up a creative Jenga game, using the block to build a platform to ollie over! We got some great content as you can see from the photos below!

Overall, we are having a great time setting up a safe zone for rangatahi in Wellington Central and Tawa. We are always welcoming the week with a smile and a growing team of friendly volunteers. We would like to thank all those who are helping out at present and the newbies starting with us in the coming weeks. Thank you for hanging out with us and creating a fun, inclusive safe zone for all.
