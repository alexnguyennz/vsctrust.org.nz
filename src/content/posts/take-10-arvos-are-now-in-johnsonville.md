We are now on week four in Johnsonville and although we had a few rangatahi visit, it still wasn’t pumping so we decided to put on a free sausage sizzle last Friday.

In preparation, we handed out flyers to schools in the area and mustered up a bunch of students from around Johnsonville. We cooked roughly 100 sausages and it is safe to say they were all given to happy folks passing by the Collective Community Hub (CCH). We had Tony and Dan from CCH on the BBQ who were fantastic local assets, as well as our Take 10 volunteer team. We were thrilled at the success of the sausage sizzle so stay tuned for future BBQs!

We have also set up at Raroa Intermediate with a bunch of keen students who come along each week. We have built some awesome relationships with the students so far and are planning leadership and team-building activities each week. Next session we will be making lunch with an emphasis on korero and kai.

All in all, Take 10 Arvo’s is steaming ahead, and we look forward to making our Summer Holiday’s plan with pop-ups, picnic’s, and outdoor games.
