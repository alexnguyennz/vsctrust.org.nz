Congratulations to the fabulous Take 10 Arvo's team who are finalists in the Wellington Airport Regional Community Awards, Education,&  Child Youth Development category.

The Arvo's team makes such a big difference to so many young people by positively influencing them through activities, time, encouraging words & connections, and most of all supporting them through all the ups and downs of being a young person right now.

A big thank you to Jess, Albion , Alice, Rose, Emma & Aaliah who give up their time each week.

We're looking forward to the awards ceremony at the end of July!
