The support of Do Some Good has become a part of Arakura School’s response to increased pressures faced by whānau and tamariki due to the continuing cost of living crisis and it’s interplay with deprivation experienced by children due to effects of poverty.

Seletute Mila, Tumuaki of Arakura School says, “We certainly have noticed it's been tougher for whānau, we're giving out more shoes, more jackets, more of everything really. The food especially has been really welcomed by whānau. We know lots of people are doing it tough. I've also been doing more pastoral care, shared between my social worker and I, and I think we're going to get more of that not less until things improve.”

Because kura (school) is a supportive environment for tamariki to develop life skills, and learn to look after themselves and others, Arakura School made a conscious choice to foster a feeling of togetherness and responsibility for tamariki when eating lunch at aura, with tamariki and kaiako (teachers) eating together in the wharekai (dining hall).

Kai supplied by Do Some Good also goes toward providing breakfast to tamariki in the wharekai each morning at the start of the school day. This support makes it easier for tamariki to start their day off well, and focus on everything that will happen at kura throughout the day ahead.

Seletute says, “When cheese costs a fortune, and we can put cheese in their toasted sammys for breakfast, it's gold. That's why kids are coming for breakfast. Because they know they're going to get that milo and cheese toasty. I think if we can look after our kids so they're not having to use up necessary brain space or worry about stuff like breakfast, then they've got a better chance to succeed in education.”

All tamariki are able to eat kai in the wharekai for breakfast and lunch each day at kura. Being able to provide kai for everyone helps to break down barriers and act as an equaliser so that tamariki and whānau do not feel different from one another depending on what whānau do or do not have.

Having kai at school also helps tamariki engage better in their learning and know their whole person is important to kaiako and other school staff.
