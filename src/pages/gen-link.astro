    <H2>How it works</H2>
    <p>
      A van will pick up seniors and transport them to the Do Some Good school
      in their area. This will happen weekly across the schools. The Generation
      Link initiative will act as the facilitator between young people and
      seniors.
    </p>
    <p>What are the benefits of Generation Link?</p>

        Promoting understanding, respect, and sharing of ideas, knowledge, and
